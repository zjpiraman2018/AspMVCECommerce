                        suspend or terminate your Account. You may be able to use your Account to gain

                        Zaldy's Ecommerce acknowledges a manufacturer’s
                        right to enter into certain exclusive distribution agreements or minimum
                        advertised price agreements for its products. However, violations of such
                        agreements do not constitute intellectual property rights infringement. As the
                        enforcement of these agreements is a matter between the manufacturer and the
                        sellers, Zaldy's Ecommerce does not assist in this type of enforcement activity and does
                        not enforce exclusive distribution rights or price-control matters except
                        within the countries that have laws specifically governing selective or
                        exclusive distribution.
